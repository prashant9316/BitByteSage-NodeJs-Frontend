          <span><p><em>Annual MSP 501 Identifies Industry’s Best-in-Class Businesses </em><em>Growing Via Recurring Revenue and Innovation</em></p>

<p><span>Xceptional has been named as one of the world’s premier managed service providers in the prestigious </span><a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/msp-501/2021-msp-501-rankings-download-the-complete-list?code=press-release"><span>2021 Channel Futures MSP 501 rankings</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Xceptional has been selected as one of the technology industry’s top-performing providers of managed services by the editors of Channel Futures. For the past 15 years, MSPs from around the globe have submitted applications to be included on this prestigious and definitive listing. The Channel Futures MSP 501 survey examines organizational performance based on annual sales, recurring revenue, profit margins, revenue mix, growth opportunities, innovation, technology solutions supported, and company and customer demographics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Managed services providers that qualify for the list must pass a rigorous review conducted by the research team and editors of Channel Futures that rank applicants using a unique methodology that weighs financial performance according to long-term health and viability, commitment to recurring revenue and operational efficiency.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.channelfutures.com/?utm_source=msp501&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2021-msp501&amp;utm_content=press-release"><span>Channel Futures</span></a> is pleased to name Xceptional to the 2021 MSP 501.</p>
<p>"We are extremely honored to be on the MSP 501 list, and we see this as a great achievement,” said Chris McKewon, CEO of Xceptional. "It is a testament to our group of talented employees, clients, and partners that collectively enable us to offer some of the best services in the industry.”</p>
<p>This year’s list attracted a record number of applicants and was one of the most competitive in the survey’s history. Winners are being recognized on the Channel Futures website and will be honored at a special ceremony at the MSP Summit held Nov. 1-2 in Las Vegas as part of the Channel Partners Conf. &amp; Expo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since its inception, the MSP 501 has evolved from a competitive ranking into a vibrant group of innovators focused on high levels of customer satisfaction at small, medium, and large organizations in public and private sectors. Today, many of their services and technology offerings focus on growing customer needs in the areas of cloud, security, collaboration, and support of hybrid work forces.</p>
<p>“The 2021 Channel Futures MSP 501 winners are the highest-performing and most innovative IT providers in the industry today. They stand head and shoulders above the competition,” said Robert DeMarzo, vice president of content for the Channel Futures and Channel Partners Conference &amp; Expo division of Informa Tech Channels. “Coordinated by Channel Futures MSP 501 editor Allison Francis, this year’s list was clearly one of the best ever on record.”</p>
<p>“Vendors that are aligned with the Channel Futures MSP 501 are driving a new wave of innovation in the industry. Through their partnerships they are demonstrating a commitment to moving the MSP and entire channel forward,” said Kelly Danziger, general manager of Informa Tech Channels. “We extend our heartfelt congratulations to the 2021 winners and gratitude to the thousands of MSPs that have contributed to the continuing growth and success of the managed services sector.”</p>
<p>The MSP 501 winners will be recognized at the MSP 501 Awards Gala at the <a href="https://www.channelpartnersconference.com/?utm_source=msp501&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=2021-msp501&amp;utm_content=press-release"><span>Channel Partners Conference &amp; Expo / MSP Summit</span></a>, Nov. 1-4, in Las Vegas.&nbsp;</p>
