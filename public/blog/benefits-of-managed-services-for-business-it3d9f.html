          <span><h1><strong>Why Managed Services Makes Sense for Your Business. </strong></h1>
<p>When it comes to partnering with a managed services provider, there are benefits to their service that your company can take advantage of. Here are some of the advantages of using a service like this instead of traditional 'fix it when it breaks' IT:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Control Costs:</strong> &nbsp;The systems required to run a business are more complex now than they were a few years ago. If a system is poorly managed, it can easily cost more than it's worth in the first place. The benefits of technology should always outweigh the costs. By having a fixed fee for that baseline of support, budgeting becomes more predictable. Of course, there will always be incidents that can be considered 'Acts of God' in the world of IT, but most of IT support can be predicted. And it should be predicted.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent Systems:</strong> It's important for employees to know how to get help when they need it. As an example, users who are covered under the Xceptional managed services offering can report an issue by calling or emailing the Help Desk Team. By having these options, the end user can get their problem resolved more quickly. Quickly resolved problems lead to better up-time. Better up-time leads to more productivity. More productivity leads to a happy business.</li>
<li><strong>Increased Knowledge:</strong> Hiring an individual IT administrator for a company only gives you the abilities of a single person. By leveraging the knowledge and experience of an entire IT team, companies get more value for their dollar.</li>
<li><strong>Service Level Agreement:</strong> By having an agreement with a company, you have a certain agreement from that company to provide a certain level of service. You do not need to worry if one of the technicians got sick this morning or needs a raise. The support company worries about those problems. Worry less.</li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>For the past several years, Xceptional has been providing high quality IT support for businesses in a variety of different industries. We've found that managed services is a great fit for businesses for a lot of different reasons, but one of the top fits is for IT administrators who do not want to deal with the support burden of the desktops in their company. By freeing up this service, they can focus on the IT strategy development of the company and the other high-level needs of the organization.</p>
