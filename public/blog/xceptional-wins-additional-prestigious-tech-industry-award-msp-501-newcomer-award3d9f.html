          <span><p><strong>SAN DIEGO, California</strong> –In addition to Xceptional ranking on The Channel Futures 2021 MSP 501 List published in June, the San Diego based IT solution provider also received The Channel Futures MSP Newcomer Award in November.</p>
<p>The Newcomer Award is bestowed upon a first-time MSP 501er that is shaking things up. To qualify, applicants must describe their journey to the MSP 501, including an overview of company history, market positioning, business model, and current go-to-market strategy. Xceptional outshined four other finalists to win the award.</p>
<p>“It was an honor to be ranked on this year’s MSP 501 list, but we are thrilled to have received the Newcomer Award,” said CEO Chris McKewon. “It is special to be recognized and celebrated by industry experts and peers. This is just the start of more great things to come for our employees, customers, and partners!”</p>
<p>Channel Futures presented this award to the organization in Las Vegas at a gala dinner honoring organizations who were placed on the 2021 MSP 501 List. This award is timely and coincides with Xceptional establishing an investment fund to expand regionally and accelerate hyper-growth.</p>
