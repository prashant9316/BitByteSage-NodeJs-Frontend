<p>Other system enhancements are needed that can make – or if ignored – potentially break your network while working from home.</p>
<p>If you aspire to have a network that enables your remote employees to work swiftly and safely, here are four system considerations designed to maximize their accessibility, productivity, and security. Consider incorporating these into your network for a comprehensive remote-work solution:</p>
<h3>1. Cloud Collaboration</h3>
<p>Collaborating in the cloud consists of using applications that streamline business communication and enhance productivity and security.</p>
<h4>Phone Services</h4>
<p>Your employees can use their smartphones and other devices to log into your network, but a better solution might be to offer hosted VoIP. Some states require employers to pay employees for the use of their own cell phone plan costs if employees are using their own cell phone plans for business calls. This can get expensive based on the number of employees businesses must cover. Hosted VoIP may turn out to be a less expensive alternative as all employees can download the VoIP app on their phones and use it for phone calls and messaging. This way, employees save their data plans and allotted minutes for themselves and small businesses save money.</p>
<h4>Telepresence &amp; Virtual Meetings</h4>
<p>While your employees are working from home, provide them with best-in-class voice, video, and web-based conferencing technology. Having these communication deliverables in the fold enables small businesses to host meetings with clients, customers, partners and colleagues safely with upgraded security measures.</p>
<h4>Messaging</h4>
<p>Make sure your staff stays connected from anywhere at any time on any device with advanced messaging applications that include access to email, SMS, chat, IM and more. These communication tools allow your employees to stay in touch with your clients 24/7 while working from home.</p>
<h3>2. Access and Monitoring</h3>
<p>Provide safe, remote access with Mobile Device Management (MDM) platforms that monitor use in real time to ensure solid network security. Keep in mind that viruses, malware, and trojans are more likely to be hiding in personally owned devices, which can result in devastating problems if they infiltrate your network.</p>
<h3>3. Virtual Desktop Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Enable your remote workers to connect their devices to a virtual desktop via a software-based gateway that connects to your server. Your IT staff will only have to manage one desktop environment no matter how many different types of computers your employees use. Additionally, your network becomes more manageable when updating applications or backing up files.</p>
<h3>4. Bandwidth and Firewall Upgrades to Enable VPN</h3>
<p>Boost your network security by enabling virtual private network (VPN) for added network protection. Many remote workers have no choice but to get online using unsecured network connections. Requiring them to go through VPN protocol adds encryption and/or a dedicated connection to the internet – ensuring safe network access and solid protection for sensitive customer information and data.</p>
<p>By starting with these four network enhancements, you’ll be well on your way to a powerful and productive remote work environment.</p>
