          <span><p><span>With the COVID-19 pandemic continuing to impact the business world, many organizations are extending their work from home arrangements well into 2021. This extension means vulnerable remote network access points will continue to be exploited by cyber criminals.</span></p> 
<p><span>Security Boulevard published a recent article that states 52% of global workers are now working from remote locations at least once per week. Skyrocketing remote access reliance is causing a rise in subsequent cyber security risks</span><span>(1)</span><span>.</span></p> 
<p><span>Why do remote workers pose such an inherent security risk? Let’s take a deeper dive into the reasons – as well as strategies organizations can employ to lessen the risk.</span></p> 
<h2><span>A Case For Simple Math</span></h2> 
<p><span>The main reason is a simple one –&nbsp; the more people using an internet connection or public Wi-Fi to access your network, the more devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops) there are for cyber criminals to target. These mobile devices may seem secure, but they’re obviously not as secure as users think.</span></p> 
<p><span>Organizations that house their assets and systems within a corporate network must get their employees to use VPNs for remote access, so they can send and receive data as if they were on their secure private networks.</span></p> 
<p><span>But even VPNs can’t protect against all forms of cyber attacks. For example, phishing scams are used to trick users into downloading malware. Cyber criminals are then able to infiltrate their devices, damage corporate systems, and steal information.</span></p> 
<h2><span>Remedies Organizations Can Employ</span></h2> 
<p><span>The most common strategy to combat these scams is implementing a multi-layer control defense that includes a combination of end-point security measures, user authentication, and network security policy enforcement. And there is good news – there are several safeguards businesses can choose from to help thwart these attacks:</span></p> 
<ul> 
 <li><b>Two-factor authentication</b><span> – typically pairs the user’s username and password with a code that is sent to a trusted device before access is granted</span></li> 
 <li><b>Multi-factor authentication</b><span> – Adds another layer on top of two-factor authentication, such as entering your mother’s maiden name</span></li> 
 <li><b>Least privilege security policy</b><span> – limits user access rights to only the resources needed to perform job duties</span></li> 
 <li><b>Client certificates</b><span> – installed on user devices that use cryptography to attest to the identity of the device</span></li> 
</ul> 
<h2><span>Specialized Outsourcing: The Way of the Future Is Here</span></h2> 
<p><span>Because the threat of cyber security breaches is ever growing, the best overall strategy may be to outsource security to a professional organization that specializes in combating these attacks.</span></p> 
<p><span>Managed security ensures your organization can rely on 24/7 network monitoring and control, breach protection, firewalls, network updates, and intrusion detection</span><span>(2)</span><span>. Your provider can conduct vulnerability audits and implement emergency incident responses should a breach occur. They can also engage in real-time security management, simplify risk management, and fortify compliance efforts.</span></p> 
<h2><span>Cost and Time Savings Are Very Real Benefits</span></h2> 
<p><span>Building solid network security measures in-house can be an expensive endeavor. And once built, they are costly to manage and maintain.</span></p> 
<p><span>Outsourcing allows organizations to only pay for what they need. A managed security provider also enables businesses to free up their time and shift their focus back to their customers – and growing the bottom line.</span></p> 
<h2><span>We’re Here to Help</span></h2> 
<p><span>Should your organization wish to discuss the benefits of outsourcing your managed security, Xceptional can conduct a security assessment and recommend a customized action plan that will boost your remote access and network protections. </span><a href="https://www.xceptional.com/contact-us/"><span>Contact us</span></a><span> today to get peace of mind and the assurance your network security and remote access points are in good hands.</span></p>
