          <span><p>Running a small- to mid-sized business (SMB) requires you to make important decisions. One of the biggest you’ll need to make in the early stages of your business involves your SMB’s computer hardware. Should you invest in a desktop computer or a laptop? Here are some considerations to help you decide.</p> 
<h3>Portability</h3> 
<p>Modern desktop computers aren't nearly as immobile as they used to be. In many cases, the screen is thin and light, and all-in-one desktops are easy to unplug, move, and plug in on the road. But there are still places where the desktop cannot go. On the other hand, laptops allow you to go anywhere, even to places without electricity. But this ability to take your work anywhere can be counterproductive; in fact, it creates more stress on employees who think they must work all the time.</p> 
<h3>Memory and speed</h3> 
<p>Before, desktop computers often had more memory than laptops, and they were faster because they had bigger processors. This has now changed, thanks to improvements in laptop technology. But until high-powered laptops become affordable to the general public, the desktop computer is going to provide your business with more memory, speed, and power for your money. If your employees’ work is limited to word processing and emailing, laptops should be enough. But anything more will probably require a desktop.</p> 
<h3>Security</h3> 
<p>An SMB’s computer hardware needs to be secure to ensure that company data doesn't end up in the wrong hands. A desktop computer is more physically secure because it’s often kept in one location, so it’s easier to guard. And because a desktop’s internet access is often a single source (whether through Wi-Fi or cable), it’s easier to defend it against malware. If you choose the laptop route, make sure to have strict policies on how to protect machines that leave the office, from physical loss (for example, theft) to unauthorized access (like using unsecured Wi-Fi).</p> 
<h3>Price</h3> 
<p>The laptop, especially the smaller notebook-style, is cheaper and available to more people. But desktop computers are becoming more affordable as more people have access to them through local channels. With a capable IT services provider, cost probably won’t be a deciding factor.</p> 
<h3>Quality</h3> 
<p>Although laptop computers provide the convenience of portability, over time, they’re prone to battery and charging cord problems. They are also easily damaged, especially if mishandled. By contrast, desktops are generally sturdier and stay only in one place. But when they do experience a problem, they can be expensive to repair.</p> 
<h3>Final recommendation</h3> 
<p>The desktop versus laptop debate is an old one, with supporters on both sides touting the advantages of their choice. A growing company usually needs a combination of both types of computers, especially as their needs evolve.</p>
