          <span><p>Keeping in touch with people through mobile devices has become cheaper these last few years. It is not surprising to see more businesses taking advantage of these affordable and versatile communication methods. Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services are a popular alternative to regular phone calls and has become a necessity for many organizations in the 21st century. Before you begin searching for a service provider, ask yourself: Why does your company need VoIP? The following tips will help you decide.</p> 
<h3><b>Flexibility or ease-of-use?</b></h3> 
<p><span>Choosing between a hosted or managed VoIP setup depends on the type of service your company is willing to pay for. Would you prefer flexibility or accessibility?</span></p> 
<p><span>Managed VoIP means that your company is in charge of managing and maintaining the on-site system. While initial costs are generally greater due to hardware and maintenance fees, when it comes to managing your own telecommunications network, a managed VoIP system provides your business with more versatility and control.</span></p> 
<p><span>On the other hand, with hosted VoIP systems, you leave the cost of new hardware and the maintenance of the telecommunications network entirely to a third party. This also frees your company from the burden of having to monitor and update your own telecommunications technologies. For many small businesses, a hosted VoIP option is the more attractive choice, as you only pay for the services you use from your hosted service provider, and these initial fees tend to be lower than the alternative.</span></p> 
<h3><b>Do you want to be more technically involved?</b></h3> 
<p><span>Deciding between a managed and a hosted VoIP system depends on how much you are willing to be involved in the management and maintenance of your VoIP setup. Generally, many companies with limited IT knowledge tend to take the hosted VoIP option while those who have more resources to customize their own telecommunications networks are more willing to go with a managed on-site VoIP setup.</span></p> 
<h3><b>Have you considered mobile VoIP systems?</b></h3> 
<p><span>With VoIP systems, telephony is no longer bound to a specific phone network. Modern employees now have a multitude of communication tools to choose from, all while accessing them anytime and anywhere. Choosing VoIP systems that offer mobile integration can allow your workers to </span><span>join </span><span>video conference calls and answer direct calls even when they are not in the office.</span></p> 
<h3><b>Does your business intend to expand?</b></h3> 
<p><span>When choosing the right VoIP system, you have to make sure that the service provider can complement your company’s plans for growth. With so many mobile devices being </span><span>developed</span><span>, selecting a VoIP service that is compatible with the latest technologies can keep you ahead of the game.</span></p> 
<p><span>Cloud-based solutions can help ease your expansion plans because these services will constantly update your telecommunications network for you. This means you never have to worry about your technology falling behind in functionality.</span></p> 
<h3><b>Check your internet connection</b></h3> 
<p><span>Regardless of which VoIP provider you choose, it is important to note that a strong and stable internet connection is necessary to support your communications network. Before purchasing from a specific VoIP provider, you should find out if your company requires a dedicated broadband or leased lines. While leased lines </span><span>offer improved voice quality</span><span>, opting for dedicated broadband services offer higher internet speeds.</span></p> 
<h3><b>How much does it cost?</b></h3> 
<p><span>How much you are willing to pay for a VoIP system? First, check how much the hardware and installation of the service costs. Then look at how much a provider charges for managing, updating, and maintaining your telecommunications system.</span></p> 
<p><span>Finally, make sure that a VoIP provider’s services meet your company’s communication needs. If the VoIP provider is offering a bundle of services that your company might not even require, then it might be in your best interest to choose a different provider.</span></p> 
<p><span>While picking and deploying a VoIP system can seem like daunting tasks, there's no denying that any good business needs VoIP to function</span><span>. If you are planning to install a new VoIP system, consider some or all of these factors to ensure you’ve made the right decision. And of course, if you’re looking for a provider, our experts are happy to help you in any way possible.</span></p>
