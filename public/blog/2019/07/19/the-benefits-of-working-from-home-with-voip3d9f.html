          <span><p>As a business owner, it’s important to raise your company’s morale to be more productive. But you can’t just keep throwing office parties every day of the year. Thanks to advancements in VoIP technologies, you can offer a better way to keep your employee’s spirits high by allowing them to work from home. Here are a few reasons why work-at-home strategies paired with VoIP systems is a good idea.</p> 
<h3>It’s good for business</h3> 
<p>Many businesses have misconceptions about their employees who choose to work from home. They assume that their employees will be less productive if they are not within the office environment, but this could not be farther from the truth. VoIP services can empower your small business and work-at-home employees in a number of ways:</p> 
<p>VoIP technologies allow you to keep your employees on track with an array of management tools like barge, monitor, and whisper, which allow you to coach and micromanage your employees.<br> The cost of business resources, furniture, space and sick days are reduced when there is an effective way for your employees to work at any location.<br> VoIP services promote continued collaboration between employees even if some of them are not in the office, allowing workflow to be more efficient.<br> As a business owner, VoIP gives your company more opportunity for growth such as by allowing you to communicate and hire people from different countries with minimal cost.</p> 
<h3>Perks for employees</h3> 
<p>Work-from-home policies with VoIP systems are also good for your employees. As more of their workload is digitized, working from home or anywhere else has never been easier. In fact, studies have shown that employees who took days to work from home were actually more productive. Part of this is because it gives them a break from the stressful office environment and, with a VoIP service readily available to them, they feel as if they haven’t missed a day’s worth of work. With the right VoIP systems installed, employees can easily collaborate with co-workers.</p> 
<p>Using VoIP at home also saves your employees from long and costly commutes. They can simply pick up their VoIP device and join a conference meeting without physically being in the boardroom. What’s more, employees who want to recall important events during conferences or seminars can use the VoIP call recording feature. This way, employees can make sure they are correctly approaching their work in their own time.</p> 
<h3>VoIP requirements for remote workers</h3> 
<p>If you’re convinced that working from home is a good solution for your company, it is essential that your chosen VoIP service provider offers the following features:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li>Voicemail – records missed calls and sends you an email of the audio file</li> 
 <li>Call forwarding – allows your employees to redirect calls between VoIP devices and their smartphones</li> 
 <li>Whisper, monitor, and barge – lets you monitor calls for quality control purposes and even coach employees without disrupting the call</li> 
 <li>Third-party integrations – streamline processes and enable employees to give instant feedback when collaborating on platforms like Office 365</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Many companies are now benefiting from a mobile and remote work environment. Although work-at-home strategies may seem like a risky venture, making the most out of your VoIP technologies will keep your employees happy and productive.
