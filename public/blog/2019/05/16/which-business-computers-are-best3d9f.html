          <span><p>We know that IT plays a big role in reaching your small- and medium-sized business (SMB) milestones. When it comes to hardware, you don’t need to be an IT expert to find the best possible solution. Here's a concise and helpful guide to the best hardware for your SMB.</p> 
<h3>Portability</h3> 
<p>Laptops allow you to keep working when you don’t have an electrical outlet. However, this ability to take your work anywhere can be counterproductive by creating more stress on employees who think they must work all the time.</p> 
<h3>Memory/Speed</h3> 
<p>Desktop computers used to have more memory and faster processors than laptops. And although high-powered laptops have caught up, they are more expensive. If work is limited to word processing and emailing, affordable less-powerful laptops should be enough. Anything more will probably require a desktop machine.</p> 
<h3>Security</h3> 
<p>Data security is necessary not only against data leaks but as protection from litigation, reputation damage, and loss of business. With a network security system and IT staff, vulnerabilities are easier to address for desktop computers within office premises. They're also less likely to be stolen.</p> 
<p>For laptops, however, mobility makes them more vulnerable. Data loss is a real risk as laptops may be connected to unsecured networks and hotspots or be lost or stolen. Protecting your laptops require special safeguards, and consequently more time and money.</p> 
<h3>Price</h3> 
<p>Laptops and desktops come in varying prices according to preferences. On the cheaper end of the price range spectrum, there are notebook-style laptops that are limited to word processing and web browsing capabilities. Desktops have affordable equivalents as well. The deciding factor when it comes to price is your IT service provider or hardware supplier. With the right partner, you should be able to get a good bulk deal on powerful but affordable desktops or laptops.</p> 
<h3>Longevity</h3> 
<p>Laptop computers may provide the convenience of mobility, but it’s much harder to upgrade their components as they get older. Laptops are also easier to drop or damage and more expensive to replace or repair. Being in a fixed location, desktops are less prone to this. And unlike laptops, many desktops are not always pre-assembled. Many desktops can be custom built with parts that are easily removed, replaced, or upgraded.</p> 
<h3>Final Recommendation</h3> 
<p>A growing company really needs a combination of both types of computers. However, a desktop computer will be generally more reliable for the fledgling company owner. Laptops should be added as budget permits to provide that extra portability and convenience, especially for managers who work remotely.</p>
