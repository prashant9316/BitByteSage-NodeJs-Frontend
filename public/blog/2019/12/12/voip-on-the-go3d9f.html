          <span><p>Businesses can benefit a lot from implementing a VoIP solution. However, without proper management and IT support for VoIP, you may see a negative impact on your productivity. You’ll experience limited communication from both customers and employees, especially when it comes to mobile or remote workers. The challenge is how you can expand your VoIP capabilities to become effective on-the-go.</p> 
<p>To cater to your out-of-office workers, there are a variety of ways you can expand the mobility of your VoIP services.</p> 
<h3>1. Look into Unified Communications (UC)</h3> 
<p>If your employees are able to bring their own personal devices to work, your IT administrators will insist that all of them comply with your company’s policies. You will need to establish good security and compliance measures in order to meet the needs of both your customers and employees.</p> 
<p>A solid solution is to look into UC, which integrates real-time communication services such as instant messaging, telephony, data sharing, and video conferencing. UC bridges the gap between VoIP and other computer-related communication technologies. It makes communication more convenient and manageable by providing a single number to reach as well as a status indicator that conveys whether employees are available or if they don't want to be disturbed.</p> 
<h3>2. Employ easy to use apps</h3> 
<p>Most top-rated business apps began as user-focused tools to help people find data more independently. Some of these apps have transformed into more customized tools focusing on specific business needs. The problem with this is that satisfying these needs often sacrifices overall usability. If your employees are struggling to use the mobile version of your VoIP solution, then they likely will dump it.</p> 
<p>This can lead to employees using unauthorized apps, which also increases security risks. To avoid this, try implementing an app or tool that is easy to use, easy to navigate, and easy to manage. Ask VoIP providers for a free demo to evaluate the intuitiveness of the software yourself.</p> 
<h3>3. Work with an experienced solution manager</h3> 
<p>It can be tough to manage your VoIP solutions as you’re expanding them. That’s why it’s best to <a href="http://www.xceptional.com/">work with an IT partner like us</a>; we have the expertise and experience to pull it off. When you <a href="http://www.xceptional.com/managed-it-services/">outsource the management</a> of your solution to us, we can get your apps and solution up and running, then administer them for you.</p> 
<h3>4. Cloud support</h3> 
<p>Having on-premise equipment and support for your VoIP solution is a good idea. However, your existing IT team may not be ready for the challenges of providing a cloud-based mobile app or voice support. We recommend you go for a hosted VoIP solution, which delivers the same cost-effective, network-based service, but the equipment is based at a provider’s site rather than in your data center. This eliminates the cost of on-premise gear, maintenance costs, and overall management, while increasing the overall effectiveness of your mobile solution.</p> 
<p>If you need to expand your VoIP mobile capabilities to enhance your efficiency and productivity, or if you’re interested to learn more about VoIP solutions, don’t hesitate to <a href="http://www.xceptional.com/contact-us/">contact us today</a>.</p>
