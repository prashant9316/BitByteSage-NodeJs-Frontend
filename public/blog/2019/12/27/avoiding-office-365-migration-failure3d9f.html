          <span><p>Office 365, the cloud-based version of Microsoft Office, is becoming the most popular software suite used by small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). With an ever-increasing number of organizations migrating to this solution, it's not surprising that other companies are also considering making the move. However, these five issues can cause an Office 365 migration to fail.</p>

<h3>Slow internet connection speeds</h3>
<p>Because Office 365 is primarily cloud-based, you're going to need a solid bandwidth connection to use it. Migrating your files and system over to Office 365 consumes a large quantity of bandwidth, which can result in slower internet speeds during the migration process. If this is being carried out during business hours, employees might struggle to do tasks that require online connection.</p>
<p>Office 365 is most often delivered over an internet connection rather than in-house servers. This means that the day-to-day demand for bandwidth will increase. If you are already noticing slow speeds and service interruptions before implementing Office 365, these issues will likely worsen after implementation.</p>
<p>To avoid this, you should ask an Office 365 provider to test your existing network connection to ensure that it can handle the migration and day-to-day operation of Office 365. If not, your provider should be able to offer you a solution.</p>
<h3>Mailboxes and files are too big</h3>
<p>While the business versions of Office 365 come with 50 GB of email storage and over 1 TB of file storage per user, accessing your emails and files online could take a while, especially if you have users whose inboxes are approaching the storage limit.</p>
<p>Larger files will cause the migration process to slow down significantly, which is why you need to prepare for this to avoid disruptions at work. Encouraging your staff to archive their inboxes and delete large, unnecessary files is a good way to ensure the migration process goes smoothly.</p>
<h3>Uninformed users</h3>
<p>On average, migrating to Office 365 takes around one to three days to complete, depending on the size of your business and the amount of data being transferred.</p>
<p>Starting the migration without informing your users that their files and email will not be accessible can lead to productivity loss and resentment towards the new platform.</p>
<p>To avoid this, you should inform your employees about the migration and how long it's going to take. You should train them how to use the new system to ensure that everyone is familiar with it before they start to use it. This will increase the overall chance that the platform migration and subsequent use will be successful.</p>
<h3>Outdated software</h3>
<p>While some versions of Office 365 come with subscriptions to the latest version of Microsoft Office, they also include built-in support for systems running older versions of Office. If your business is using a version of Office that is older than Office 2010 (e.g., Office 2003), you might have trouble using Office 365.</p>
<p>When it comes to web browsers, Chrome and Firefox won't give you too many problems. However, if you're utilizing their outdated versions, using Office 365 will be extremely difficult. Your provider should tell you if your existing software needs to be updated before migrating to Office 365.</p>
<h3>Doing the process yourself</h3>
<p>On paper, migrating to Office 365 may seem like a simple and straightforward process. This leads many businesses to believe that they can do the entire migration process without the assistance of experts. However, without proper guidance, you may run into problems that can harm vital business operations.</p>
