          <span><p>More businesses are now allowing their employees to use mobile devices to increase productivity and profitability. But smartphones and tablets are just as vulnerable to hacking as desktops and laptops. Worse, employees may be exposing their mobile devices unwittingly to cybercriminals. Here are some helpful tips to keep your devices safe.</p> 
<h3>Ensure mobile OS is up-to-date</h3> 
<p>The updates on Apple and Android operating systems (OSs) improve overall user experience, but their most important function is to fix security vulnerabilities. Reduce your business’s exposure to threats by installing updates for <em>all</em> devices as soon as they become available. Don't wait for a few weeks or months to update, as this give hackers ample time to exploit vulnerabilities on devices that run on an outdated OS.</p> 
<h3>Install business applications only</h3> 
<p>Downloading apps seems harmless. But lenient policies on what should and shouldn’t be downloaded on company mobile devices could lead to staff downloading and installing non-business-related apps from third-party stores, most of which are notorious for malicious advertising codes and other threats.</p> 
<h3>Be careful when connecting to public Wi-Fi networks</h3> 
<p>Emergency situations may compel you to use password-free Wi-Fi networks in hotels, airports, cafes, and other public places. Connecting to an open network can expose your confidential information and sensitive company data to hackers connected to the same network.</p> 
<p>You can avoid this by providing a practical internet data plan, preferably one that includes roaming services, for remote workers. And if you really have to connect to an open Wi-Fi, don’t use the connection for transferring sensitive data.</p> 
<h3>Enable phone tracking tools</h3> 
<p>It’s sad but inevitable — losing a company-issued mobile device happens. Devices can be misplaced or stolen, and enabling Find My iPhone for iOS devices, GPS Phone Tracker for Android, or any device-tracking app helps users locate lost phones. Some also have the option to delete data in stolen devices. Downloading and setting up such an app only takes a few minutes, and it will give you peace of mind knowing that even if your phone is lost or stolen, its contents will not be compromised.</p> 
<h3>Screen SMS carefully</h3> 
<p>SMS phishing can be used to trick you into clicking malicious links. Hackers send messages purporting to be from someone you know, asking you to urgently send confidential data. Should you encounter such an SMS, you can either delete it or alert your IT department. You can also block unknown senders without even opening their message.</p> 
<p>Mobile devices are becoming more critical to operations. And with more devices open to attack, businesses must bolster their cyber security efforts. Hackers will exploit every possible vulnerability, and that includes those in unsecured smartphones and tablets. <a href="http://www.xceptional.com/about-us/contact-us/">Get in touch with us</a> if you need comprehensive security solutions for your business.</p>
