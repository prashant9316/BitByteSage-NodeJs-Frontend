          <span><p>What do your steps in the IT support process look like? Are there various layers of threat detection involved? Are you delegating duties to the right people? Do you have a plan for improvement? What, specifically, are you doing to keep incidents from being a common theme? To improve your IT support process, consider the following:</p> 
<p><b>Improving Assessment<br> </b><br> When an incident occurs, the faster you respond, the better off you’ll be. That’s why an assessment team needs to be ready to discover the true impact of an incident, the parties it affected, and if there is any data loss involved.</p> 
<p>While this assessment needs to occur swiftly, it also needs to be thorough and inform your entire team on the next steps that need to be taken to fully resolve the incident. For better transparency, be sure to keep a log of the assessment so everyone can be in the know.</p> 
<p><b>Delegation of Duties</b></p> 
<p>Does everyone know exactly how they’re going to respond to an incident? The way you delegate these responses should be based on the unique skill set of each individual on the team, their role in the company, and their ability to be highly effective.</p> 
<p>For example, everyone needs to be on board in the process - even your newest employees. So the least experienced associates should be handling simple requests, while the more complex requests should go to senior team members.</p> 
<p><b>Review the Process</b></p> 
<p>Nothing that occurs during an incident response should be immune from review. How did your team communicate during the incident? How long did it take to manage specific parts of the incident response?</p> 
<p>Your review of the situation will help highlight areas that need improvement. Stay flexible in your IT support process planning so you can make these changes as needed.</p> 
<p><b>Using the Right Tools</b></p> 
<p>Not only does your IT team need to be excellent communicators and thorough in their work, but they also need the right support tools.</p> 
<p>These tools should give them an advantage in monitoring the system and sending out alerts when something is not right. Unfortunately, finding the right tools isn’t that easy. With so many to choose from, some organizations are blindly selecting what they think&nbsp;<i>might</i>&nbsp;be the best suite of tools only to find out later that they made a poor decision.</p>
