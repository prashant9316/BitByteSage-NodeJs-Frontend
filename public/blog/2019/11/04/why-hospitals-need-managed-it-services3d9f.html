          <span><p>Healthcare trends point towards heavy reliance on tech such as telemedicine, mobile health solutions, surgical robotics, and most significantly, constantly evolving data management practices. Because of this, managed services providers (MSPs) are a valuable commodity.</p> 
<p>Here are some things to look for in a managed services provider before you consider partnering with one.</p> 
<h3>They guarantee response times</h3> 
<p>When it comes to providing healthcare services, fast response is not the only thing that matters. You should always make sure that your provider guarantees response times, and that you’re able to contact them 24/7. In case something breaks or you come across technical issues in the dead of night, your best bet would be to contact your service provider, not to try fixing things on your own. Therefore, you need a provider who is able to give assistance whenever you need it most.</p> 
<h3>They support a business continuity plan</h3> 
<p>You risk putting your organization in jeopardy if your MSP can’t assist in your recovery from major outages or natural disasters. A business continuity plan is an absolute necessity in your healthcare organization — you simply can’t afford to lose all your valuable medical data in the event of a disaster. You need all the help you can get from your MSP to maintain redundant systems and manage automatic failovers.</p> 
<h3>They provide proactive security</h3> 
<p>In the world of healthcare data security, complying with HIPAA mandates is essential. Failing to meet regulations may result in huge fines, serious penalties, and even the withdrawal of your license to operate. The ideal managed services provider should offer core security services that include identity-based security and encryption, authorized privileges and access control, and data accountability and integrity.</p> 
<h3>They offer staffing services</h3> 
<p>Healthcare staffing shouldn’t be a hassle but, thanks to the changing dynamics of healthcare IT requiring a sophisticated workforce, that’s exactly what it can become. You need a managed services provider that assumes full responsibility for your clinical labor while providing you with a single point of contact for all your staffing operations, including account management, customer support, order placement, and more.</p> 
<p>Choosing the right MSP can be time-consuming, but when you do make the switch, they can streamline your operations, reduce operational costs, and enhance workforce transparency.</p>
