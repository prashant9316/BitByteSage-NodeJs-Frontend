          <span><p>Not too long ago, cloud apps and platforms were the answer to IT efficiency. Today, virtualization is the solution everyone is talking about. And as a business owner, you probably want to know if virtualization can improve your business’s processes.</p> 
<h3>What is virtualization?</h3> 
<p>Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of a device or resource, anything from a server to an operating system. This allows you to turn one physical server into a group of virtual servers that all share the same resources.</p> 
<h3>How is it different from other systems?</h3> 
<p>If you're paying a provider for access to virtual IT resources, you have instant access to nearly limitless computing resources. It also gets rid of haphazard IT rooms, cables, and bulky hardware, reducing your overall IT overhead and management costs.</p> 
<p>While many people confuse virtualization with the cloud, it's better to think of virtualization as one of the many tools that enables cloud technology to function. For example, if you wanted to simultaneously run Windows and Mac OS X on the same computer, virtualization could do that. This improves overall application performance due to technology that can balance resources, and provide only what the user needs.</p> 
<h3>When should you virtualize?</h3> 
<p>Virtualization can be a solution for many businesses, but not for all. The key is to know exactly when to virtualize. Here are four situations where a business should make the leap:</p> 
<ul> 
 <li><strong>Virtualize if you rely on technology</strong> – Companies that are dependant on technology often end up with more hardware than they actually need. Virtualization prevents this from happening with more efficient use of IT.</li> 
 <li><strong>Virtualize if your company exceeds 20 employees</strong> – Tech experts agree that there is no need for virtualization if you employ fewer than 10-20 employees. With that number, traditional servers are more than enough to cater to your needs.</li> 
 <li><strong>Virtualize if you can cover the costs</strong> – While virtualization is meant to reduce costs, it still requires an initial investment. The cost of virtualization can be high for small businesses to implement, but you have the option of working with an IT partner like us. We can help you realize cost-savings or even a return on investment.</li> 
 <li><strong>Virtualize if you want more space</strong> – Certain business operators throw away a big chunk of their budget on extra office space to house large server racks, wires, or even IT personnel to maintain them. In this situation, virtualization can save space while reducing hardware costs.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There are several reasons why businesses look into virtualization. Like any type of technology, it’s a tradeoff between practicality and money.
