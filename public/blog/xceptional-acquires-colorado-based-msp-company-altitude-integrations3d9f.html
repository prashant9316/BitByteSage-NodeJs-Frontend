          <span><p><span>SAN DIEGO,California–</span><span>Xceptional, an award-winning IT managed services provider,</span><br><span>has acquired Altitude Integrations, a Colorado based managed service provider.

<p><span>“This is the beginning of a new era for both organizations, and we are excited for our</span><br><span>clients, employees, partners, and shareholders,” Chris McKewon, CEO of Xceptional,</span><br><span>stated. “Altitude Integrations and Xceptional share the same values, beliefs, and</span><br><span>commitment to customer satisfaction and value creation.
