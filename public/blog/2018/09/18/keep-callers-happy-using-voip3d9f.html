          <span><p><span>If you don’t want your customers to switch to your competitors, customer satisfaction should be on top of your priority list. One sure way to keep them satisfied is by having a professional yet customer-friendly phone strategy. Something as simple as your automated on-hold messages may seem inconsequential, but when people need help, you don't want them to feel ignored or neglected. Here are tips on designing great on-hold messages.<br> </span></p> 
<h3>Hire professionals to record your on-hold message</h3> 
<p>On-hold messages are your customers’ first point of contact with your business when they need help, so your messages should be professionally recorded. You may be tempted to have an in-house production because it will initially cost less than hiring a professional voice talent and renting a studio, but in the long run, professionally recorded messages in your company’s Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems will be more beneficial.</p> 
<p>Voice talents have the skills and equipment to give your phone system that professional, friendly, and pleasant feel. If you want to sound sincere about helping your customers with their issues, invest in professionally recorded on-hold messages.</p> 
<h3>Use calming on-hold music to keep callers engaged</h3> 
<p>Another strategy to keep customers from hanging up while they're on hold is putting on music while they’re waiting. The trick for keeping callers calm is picking the right music. You might think that your choice of music is a minute detail, but it can make or break whether customers decide to leave or stay. You need to find a balance between engaging and relaxing, which is much easier when you have the power to pick or change tunes in just a few minutes. Cloud-based phone systems allow you to do exactly this by letting you test out different tunes.</p> 
<h3>Provide clear and useful information</h3> 
<p>Not everyone who calls your customer service hotline has a problem. Sometimes, people just need a piece of information. Use your IVRs to help callers find non-critical, frequently asked information such as business operating hours, special offers, and minor account updates. You can also deploy a more complicated system that redirects customers to specific concerns, like account management and payment instructions. This frees customer service representatives to take care of issues that need actual human interactions, like walkthroughs and policy misunderstandings.</p> 
<h3>Connect the call to a real person</h3> 
<p>According to a study, <a href="http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/The-Tipping-Point/Most-People-Prefer-Human-Interactions-in-Customer-Service-110834.aspx">83% of customers prefer human interaction</a> over automated channels when solving customer service issues. Your automated recordings may lessen customers’ agitation or frustration, but nothing beats talking to a real person. Always provide an immediate option to talk to a customer service representative in your IVR. Most companies dedicate a particular number during calls to be connected to a real person who can help them with their concerns.This shows that you are serious in addressing your customers’ problems.</p>
