          <span><p>More hospital wireless networks are making use of Mobile Device Management (MDM) software to monitor every device connected to their network. Read on to learn its numerous benefits and whether or not having it is necessary.</p> 
<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p> 
<p>Governments have established several regulations, such as HIPAA, to protect patient records, but mobile devices are posing a major challenge to these regulations. If the employee is caught violating the rules, he or she can be penalized with a fine as high as $1.5 million.</p> 
<p>The largest compliance risk associated with the use of mobile devices is data leakage. The most common example of this is an employee having sensitive data or footage in his or her phone and then uploading it on social media.</p> 
<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p> 
<p>Many practices are adopting the bring your own device (BYOD) policy, encouraging employees to use their own tablets, computers, and smartphones for work. Mobile device management solutions make it possible for IT administrators to remotely monitor and control these devices. But more importantly, organizations benefit from the massive cost savings, since they don't have to purchase the devices for their staff.</p> 
<p><strong>Better device security</strong></p> 
<p>As long as the systems administrator uses MDM, it will be a challenge for hackers to gain access to any confidential information, regardless of where in the hospital the device is. If there is sensitive data in an employee’s device and it is stolen or lost, MDM software can erase all the content.</p> 
<p>Proper MDM applications can encrypt files in a portable device and distinguish the corporate data from the employee’s personal information. In the event that the employee is terminated or resigns, the MDM software will delete only the corporate data, leaving the rest of the content untouched.</p> 
<p><strong>Remote Device Management</strong></p> 
<p>Thanks to advancements in technology, it’s no surprise that more healthcare systems are operating on mobile platforms such as Android devices, iPhones, iPads, and netbooks. Since these devices are now a crucial component of patient care, the IT department must be able to manage or control these devices in case there’s ever an issue. MDM solutions can give them this control.</p> 
<p><strong>No changes to infrastructure</strong></p> 
<p>MDM applications will not demand a change in the Wi-Fi infrastructure of the building, but if the system cannot handle all the devices that are logged in to the network, the support team will have difficulties managing all medical applications and BYOD. If the hospital has a strong wireless network though, there will be no need to make changes to the system.</p> 
<p>These are just some of the advantages to having Mobile Device Management in the healthcare industry.
