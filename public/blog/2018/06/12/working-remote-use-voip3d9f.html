          <span><p>The workplace has been steadily evolving, and much of this is fueled by the rise of remote workers. Last year’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/us/remote-workers-work-from-home.html">Gallup survey</a> showed that of more than 15,000 adults asked, 43% of them worked outside of the office. Why does remote working look more appealing to employees these days?</p> 
<h3>The appeal of working remote</h3> 
<p>The perks of telecommuting, or working remotely, go beyond wearing your jammies while doing your job. Employees are unbound by time and space, so talent can come from anywhere. They don't have to beat the traffic during rush hour since they can work in the comforts of their home or any place of their choice. Less stress and favorable working conditions help increase employees' morale.</p> 
<p>But there are challenges to having workers physically apart. It’s not as easy to turn to a colleague to consult when he or she is across town. Meetings can be tedious to set up, and correspondences via email lose their immediacy. And there’s more possibility of miscommunication when you cannot see the other person’s body language.</p> 
<h3>VoIP as a must-have tool for telecommuting</h3> 
<p>For remote working to work, an effective and reliable system of communication is necessary. That’s why companies turn to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology.</p> 
<p>VoIP is a telephony system that uses the Internet to transmit data. So VoIP systems can transmit a variety of data aside from audio -- video, photo, file, etc. The more popular examples of applications using VoIP technology are Whatsapp, Facebook Video and Voice Chat, Skype, and Google Phone, to name a few.</p> 
<p>VoIP systems make telecommuting viable. It allows remote workers to connect to one another in real time, at any time. Communication lines aren’t limited to audio; video calls bring remote workers face to face with one another. They can send files back and forth at the speed of a click, leave comments, or edit each other’s work with ease.</p> 
<p>One of the best things about VoIP systems is that they're very affordable. Whether audio or video, so long as it’s sent through the Internet, it’s free. And because VoIP systems have flexible and changeable structures, it’s easy to expand or downsize as needed.</p> 
<h3>Getting the best out of VoIP</h3> 
<p>Here are a few ways remote workers can make the most out of their VoIP systems:</p> 
<ol> 
 <li><em>Use a hosted VoIP system</em>. The system is hosted in the cloud, usually maintained by a third-party provider. Being in the cloud means easier access for remote workers from different locations. Having an outsourced provider is more convenient because they have the experience and expertise to ensure the VoIP system is always in tip-top shape.</li> 
 <li><em>Choose one with mobile app</em>. This allows greater mobility for remote workers, as they do not always need to be in front of their desktops. And the more mobile your workers, the more agile your company.</li> 
 <li><em>Get one that uses a VPN connection</em>. A virtual private network (VPN) allows different computers to connect safely and securely via the Internet. Remote workers can send and share data without fear of cyberattackers even when they are using public WiFi networks such as those in coffee shops, malls, and hotels.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>The flexibility of VoIP systems means one can be customized for you. If you need a VoIP telephony system that’s just right for your needs, call us today.</p>
