          <span><p><strong>SAN DIEGO, California</strong>--Xceptional, the award-winning, San Diego-Based Managed Services Provider, has announced a new partnership with the recognized leader in edge cloud services <span><a href="https://www.zadara.com/about/"><span>Zadara</span></a></span>, to bring innovative new cloud solutions to the market. <br><br></p>

<p>“<span>Thr</span>ough this new partnership, Xceptional clients will have more cloud-based storage, compute, and networking solution options available to them when deciding on future needs”, stated VP of Marketing and Sales, Mark Dallmeier. “Zadara also provides a more predictable and cost-effective solution to our clients as their billing is based on a pay-only-for-what-you-use model.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2007 as Xceptional Networks, by Chris McKewon, the company began as a Value-Added Reseller and IT Integrator. Since that time, Xceptional has built a reputation in the southwest for delivering superior Unified Communications, Data Center, and Networking Solutions that help customers drive positive business outcomes.</p>
<p><u>Zadara</u> was established in 2011 by industry veterans and is headquartered in Irvine, California. Zadara is a disruptor in the technology industry - their Edge Cloud Platform brings award-winning infrastructure technology, including compute, storage, and networking, to where customers need it most. Zadara’s solutions have been recognized in the industry for innovation and leadership recently by Gartner, GigaOm, CRN’s Tech Innovator Awards, and Deloitte Technology Fast 500.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with Zadara enables us to provide innovative cloud enabled services to the market. In 2021 we introduced new Unified Communication as a Service, Backup as a Service, Compliance as a Service, and Security as a Service offerings that will help clients reduce the risk, cost, and time associated with running, maintaining, and operating critical IT systems, while defending and protecting their data and systems.” said CEO Chris McKewon. “Zadara enables us to scale and deliver our managed services, cloud infrastructure, compute, and storage portfolio globally through its 300 points of presence. Our clients benefit because as their businesses grow and expand regionally, nationally, or globally, our personalized service coverage can expand with them.”</p>
<p>As part of this strategic partnership, Xceptional joined <span><a href="https://www.zadara.com/federated-edge/"><span>Zadara’s Federated Edge program</span></a></span> for service providers to offer its customers over 300 cloud locations. Through this program, Xceptional can provision IT ‘as-a-Service’ business solutions for customers as close as necessary to those customers’ workloads, via a network of Service Provider members. This industry leading program was recognized this month by CRN’s 2021 Tech Innovator Award as a finalist.</p>
<p>Xceptional and Zadara have already partnered together to host a LinkedIn Live Ask the Experts Q&amp;A session around the topics of cybersecurity and ransomware in honor of National Cybersecurity Awareness Month. It was Xceptional’s most engaged event this year.</p>
<p>“This is the first of many strategic partnership announcements planned for Xceptional. As the company continues to grow and expand, so will our portfolio and partnerships. It is an exciting time as we are committed to bringing more innovative and proven solutions into the market to address the unique business, financial, and security requirements of our clients,” Dallmeier shared.</p>
