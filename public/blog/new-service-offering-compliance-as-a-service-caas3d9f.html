          <span><p>Xceptional is pleased to announce an exciting, new <a href="https://www.xceptional.com/services/caas" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Compliance-as-a-Service offering</a> for all clients that will be available at the end of June 2022. Please read below for additional information about this new service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><span>The Growing Cost &amp; Complexity of Regulatory Compliance&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p>According to the<a href="https://chubbcyberindex.com/"> <span>Chubb Cyber Index</span></a> the Healthcare, Manufacturing, Business Services, Public Sector, Education, and Information Technology industries have all experienced between 200% and 3000% growth in cyber-incidents and attacks over the last 24-36 months.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The growing number of cyber-attacks and data breaches across multiple industry segments is driving greater regulatory oversight and rule changes that result in additional operational, management, and reporting costs on organizations operating within or servicing regulated industries.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As of June 2022, there were over 122 regulatory actions under review by the U.S. Federal Government according to The Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs<a href="http://www.reginfo.gov/"> <span>website</span></a>. <em>Once these new actions are implemented, organizations across multiple industries will be required to invest more time, money, energy, and effort to adhere to these new actions.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>With over 395,608 regulatory restrictions, </strong><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2020-11-03/which-state-has-the-most-regulations"><strong><span>California is the MOST regulated State in the U.S</span></strong></a><strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Healthcare is a heavily regulated industry, yet over the last 5 years hundreds of Healthcare providers have fallen victim to malware, hacking, ransomware, social engineering, and other malicious cyber-attacks, so it should be no surprise that 11 of the 51 open regulatory actions that are under review are related to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p><em>The complexity of federal, state, and international regulatory systems have created a significant cost burden on small and medium sized businesses, which account for 99.7% of U.S. companies</em> and over half of private-sector workers. <em><span>Small and medium sized businesses pay on average $11,700 per year per employee in regulatory costs</span></em>, <span>and the costs of regulation on businesses with 50 or less employees are nearly 20% higher than larger companies.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The costs associated with federal regulations on small and medium sized businesses are estimated to total over $40 billion annually according to the</strong><a href="https://www.uschamberfoundation.org/smallbizregs"> <strong><span>US Chamber Foundation</span></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>According to the<a href="https://www.assentcompliance.com/stateofcompliance/?utm_channel=paid&amp;utm_content=&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=SC:GoMD:SeAdCNTNT:RprtOJ:LeGePJ:SOCPD:PCFM:GlPrCoRG:NA:USLG:En&amp;sem_account_id=1266304530&amp;sem_campaign_id=10256618138&amp;sem_ad_group_id=101203089334&amp;sem_device_type=c&amp;sem_keyword=compliance%20trends%202021&amp;sem_matchtype=b&amp;sem_ad_id=519598863058&amp;sem_network=g&amp;sem_target_id=kwd-1254214141831&amp;sem_feed_item_id=&amp;utm_term=compliance%20trends%202021&amp;sem_location_id=9061211&amp;sem_placement=&amp;sem_placement_category=&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw78yFBhCZARIsAOxgSx0N7J8gPXBNSO69NI-_if9Ly7dOMOmfUNPqE8f4GUqnJD3NsYnu2V4aAgJWEALw_wcB"> <span>2020 Assent Compliance Report</span></a>, <em>88% of companies expect to spend more time on compliance efforts over the next three years. This demonstrates companies will require a steady increase in resources to manage compliance programs</em>. At the same time, organizational confidence in meeting compliance demands has dropped from 6.2 to 5.4 (out of 10) over the last 24 months.</p>
