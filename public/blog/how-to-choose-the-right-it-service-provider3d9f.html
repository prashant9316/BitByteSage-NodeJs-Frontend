          <span><p><span>Selecting the right IT service is essential to business success, as it streamlines operations considerably. IT service management is defined as applying technical and business expertise to help organizations create, manage, optimize, and access relevant information and business processes. These services are usually outsourced, hence the issue of finding the right provider for your business needs.</span></p>

<p><span>So what does it take to choose the right IT service provider?</span></p>
<h3><span>First: Knowing What to Look For </span></h3>
<p><span>The first step in selecting any service provider for your business, whether it be an IT services company or any other provider, is to know what you're looking for. Such criteria of course include verifiable competence, experience and track record, reliability and punctuality, and adherence to industry standard rates (i.e. won't surprise you with outrageous invoices). You want a provider with talent, training, and experience to take care of your business needs, especially when it comes to IT!</span></p>
<p><span>Some of the most important areas to consider when selecting an IT services company include: IT certifications and experience, payment terms, IT product repair capabilities, and availability/bandwidth. Following are some important questions to ask when choosing the best IT company.</span></p>
<h3><span>Certifications and Experience</span></h3>
<p><span>When it comes to IT certifications, there are any number of different products, services, and training levels an IT professional can be certified in. Generally, the more, the better. But at the very least, some of the key certifications that contain industry standard best practices would be: Project Management Professional (PMP), Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE), Certified Information Systems Security Professional (CISSP), Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCSP), CompTIA A+, and Certified Systems Information Auditor (CSIA). It would also serve to know how long the IT provider has been in business, get a list of companies they've worked with, and receive any references to organizations with similar equipment and needs to your own. </span></p>
<h3><span>Flexibility and Payment</span></h3>
<p><span>If you're satisfied with the IT company's level of expertise, the next step is to determine the company's flexibility and what you're going to get for what you're paying. Does the IT provider offer block hour arrangements that provide a certain amount of work per month for a fixed price? Will the provider fix something that's broken for an hourly rate? How about service agreements that detail exactly what the provider will do for you every month in terms of maintenance and repairs?</span></p>
<p><span>The goal is to find a provider who offers clear terms of service and billing, and aligns with your own business' values and financial capacity.</span></p>
<h3><span>Requesting Service and Product Repairs</span></h3>
<p><span>Fixing broken equipment is one of the IT provider's hallmark services, so it's very important to go over what your potential provider's repair services entail. Are you required to call the provider? Send them emails? Is there an online client portal that allows you to request help as needed?. Additionally, do they have a general time frame with regards to repair turnaround, and does that vary based on the type of repair? If so, what are the standard repair timelines per product or service? Do they specialize in particular repairs, whether it be hardware, software, cloud services, etc., or are they generally proficient across the board? It's also recommended that you ask how the provider handles service requests internally to give you a much better idea of how it operates and the most efficient method of communicating a service request. </span></p>
<h3><span>An Ounce Of Prevention</span></h3>
<p><span>Repairs aren't the only IT provider cornerstone-preventative measures are just as important. Remote monitoring and access are two trending services IT providers offer, with some providing monitoring by the hour or even minute. This means the provider is instantly notified of an issue and will rectify the issue before it becomes a major problem. It's therefore important to determine if the provider you're considering offers these services, and if remote monitoring software is compatible with your system. It's also important to inquire as to whether the provider has the bandwidth to service your company properly, and how fully utilized the provider's team is or is not.</span></p>
<h3><span>Additional Tips</span></h3>
<p><span>Finding the right IT provider also means inquiring about how quickly they can dispatch help, especially in the event of an IT emergency. Making sure an IT service provider can meet your company's needs at the right price and within the right timeframe is key.&nbsp;</span></p></span>
