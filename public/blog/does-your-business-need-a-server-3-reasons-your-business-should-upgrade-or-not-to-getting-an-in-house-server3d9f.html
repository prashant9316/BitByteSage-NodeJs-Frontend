          <span><p>It is more common than ever for offices - especially for larger companies - to possess two different types of computers: a computer on which individuals perform their daily tasks and one centralized computer that stores the resources all other computers on the network can access. The second type of computer is known as a server, and its function is to hold the information that's on all of the computers, allow and deny access of various files to appropriate parties, as well as to provide a high level of security for the company's information. While servers are regarded as a must for most businesses, does yours need one? If you think it does, is an in-house server the way to go?</p>

<p>Consider these three reasons as to why you should or shouldn't upgrade to an in-house server:</p>
<h3>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Expense of In-House Servers</h3>
<p><span>Servers can be costly, depending on which you decide to go with. It's no secret that larger companies are more likely to have in-house servers than smaller ones. In-house servers often mean investing in expensive equipment and upgrades, as well as office space to store the server. Professionals generally need to be called in to maintain the equipment, or if your business has an IT department, problematic servers can monopolize valuable time best spent on other projects. For this reason, many companies are switching over to Cloud-based servers,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>which don't require any physical equipment, but rather just payment for a service subscription. Plus, employers with a number of telecommuters also appreciate the ease with which their employees can access all materials from wherever they are, as long as there's an established online connection.</span></p>
<h3>2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Much Control Do You Want?</h3>
<p>When your server is located in-house, you have complete control over it. While Cloud-based services are known for being secure, some businesses may feel more comfortable having their server in a place they can physically access and safeguard in a way that makes the most sense for their company (there are a few ways to go about this).</p>
<h3>3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dealing with Crashes and Downtime</h3>
<p>We've all been through it: You're working on a document, and the computer freezes. You go to restart it, and it shuts off but doesn't turn on again. You take it in to be repaired, and hope and pray for a good outcome. Alas, all of your documents, including the one you were just working on, are gone forever. What a nightmare. One of the central ideas behind having a server is that all of your saved documents are backed up, all of the time. Thus, when your computer goes down, all hope is not lost.</p>
<p>At Xceptional, our team often recommends clients adopt a cloud-based approach. However, in cases where in-house servers are more fitting, we highly recommend working with such systems as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Network Attached Storage Device</a> (NAS), Windows, and Mac OS X servers, which are simple and easily customizable. Either way, though, having a server is likely to save you both headache and heartache in the long run, even if you're the only person accessing it. It will safeguard your files, making sharing easier across devices, and securely store information for the whole company. If you're not sure whether a server - or which server - is suitable for your company, <a href="https://www.xceptional.com/contact-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">contact</a> Xceptional.
