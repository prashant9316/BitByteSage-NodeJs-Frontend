          <span><p><a href="https://www.cioreview.com/"><span>CIO Review</span></a><span> recently announced their Most Promising Managed IT Award winners for 2021, and </span><b>Xceptional was selected as one of the top companies at the forefront of providing managed IT services and transforming businesses.</b></p> 
<p><span>Danielle Carpenter, COO, was recently interviewed for the publication’s award winners edition. “We are thrilled to be receiving </span><a href="https://managed-it-services.cioreview.com/vendor/2021/xceptional"><span>CIO Review’s award</span></a><span>. It’s further confirmation that we continue to build success for our clients by providing managed services along with developing and implementing strong technology and security platforms that maximize and protect their networks,” she said.</span></p> 
<h2><span>The Company Was Initially Established to Fill a Void</span></h2> 
<p><span>Ms. Carpenter said they created Xceptional to </span><b>help small and midsize businesses that lack dedicated IT teams needed to select new technologies, provide desktop support, fix system issues, and manage and maintain networks.</b></p> 
<p><span>Since the early days of 2007, CEO Chris McKewon founded Xceptional as a reseller and technology integrator that helped clients design and implement technology solutions with the goal of building value and sustaining relationships. He found there wasn’t a broad understanding of technology that could be used to help grow and ultimately benefit small and midsize companies at that time.</span></p> 
<p><span>Since then, </span><b>Xceptional teams have worked hard to be a “trusted advisor” to their clients</b><span> that don’t have the technology expertise needed to maximize their technology investments.</span></p> 
<p><span>The article mentions that the company extended its footprint into managed IT services in 2012, providing a wide range of offerings to help businesses meet their varying IT needs.</span></p> 
<h2><span>Fast Forward Ahead – 19 Years After Inception</span></h2> 
<p><span>The article touts today’s version of Xceptional’s managed IT service portfolio that includes, but isn’t limited to, complete managed support, 24/7 monitoring, performance tuning and WAN optimization, cloud integration and implementation, and cyber security audits.</span></p> 
<p><span>Carpenter added, “Our comprehensive service portfolio is aimed at augmenting our clients’ IT capabilities. For small and midsize businesses that lack resources to hire full time IT experts, we act as an extended team to help them build a powerful IT strategy and pave the way for them to leverage technology at scale.”</span></p> 
<p><span>She stated in the article that </span><b>they are also now able to help enterprise-level customers that need to outsource a specialized portion of their IT management and provide high level technical support </b><span>when needed. This allows the customer to save significantly on their FTE by leveraging Xceptional’s flexible service portfolio.</span></p> 
<p><span>Xceptional’s level of commitment to building solutions that work are the cornerstone of their clients’ success. The article concludes that going forward, </span><b>the company envisions extending its reach in the managed IT services space by implementing several additional enhancements to its service offerings.</b></p> 
<h2><span>We’re Here to Help</span></h2> 
<p><span>If your organization needs help with your IT services, we can help. No matter if you’re a small or midsize business with little or no in-house IT or an enterprise seeking additional managed support to lighten the load of your IT teams, together we can create the right mix of outsourced IT to help your business succeed.</span></p>
